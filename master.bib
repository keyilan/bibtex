  abstract = {The case-marking systems of Tibeto-Burman languages are a longstanding problem in both synchronic description and analysis and historical reconstruction. Early research on the family tended to characterize the family, and especially the Tibetan languages, as ergative. But work over the last two decades has demonstrated, first with respect to Tibetan, and then to other languages of the family, that the prevalent ―alignment‖ is a ―pragmatic ergative‖ pattern in which a case marker is optionally present on A and some S arguments of the clause. The ―optional‖ presence of the ergative marking is determined by semantic factors, especially agentivity and perfectivity, and pragmatic factors, particularly contrast. It is now clear that this grammatical phenomena characterizes the family as a whole, although there are a few languages which show more familiar typological profiles.},

Language moves down time in a current of its own making. It has a drift... The linguistic drift has direction. In other words, only those individual variations embody it or carry it which move in a certain direction, just as only certain wave movements in the bay outline the tide. The drift of a language is constituted by the unconscious selection on the part of its speakers of those individual variations that are cumulative in some special direction. This direction may be inferred, in the main, from the past history of the language. (1921:150/155)}
